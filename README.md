An app to simulate the financial loan transaction and record keeping. I have attempted to follow the Domain Driven Design (DDD) and API first approach. The only portion I have is tied to event processing, specifically the loan module (package) updating the initial payment application via the CustomerLoanApplication entity. The various subsequent installments will be recorded in the payment history table until the loan is fully settled. The following picture seeks to show all modules planned.
